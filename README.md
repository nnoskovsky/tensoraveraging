# tensoraveraging
I passed the theoretical minimum of Landau in mathematics-1, and the third problem from it is about averaging a tensor object, often of course they can be solved through mathematical statistics "head-on", but most often the problem is reduced to averaging a certain tensor object due to the vector nature of the problem and the isotropy and invariance of the object itself. For example, using the reasoning that the only invariant rank 2 tensor is only \delta_ab, you can get the answer up to a constant, and then find the constant itself through the trace of the matrices.
