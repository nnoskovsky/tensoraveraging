# tensoraveraging
I passed the theoretical minimum of Landau in mathematics-1 and the third problem from it is about averaging a tensor object, often of course they can be solved through mathematical statistics "head-on", but most often the problem is reduced to averaging a certain tensor object due to the vector nature of the problem and the isotropy and invariance
